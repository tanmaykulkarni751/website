Fixed
1. Lighthouse report recommended using newer image formats. Thus, I converted currently used jpg and png images into webp, resulting in a better lighthouse report. 
2. Changed font colors in header and footer because lighthouse report suggested that color contrast is not optimal.
3. Added meta description to documents resulting in increased SEO score.

Increased performance score by 10 points.
