        <p>
            In this paper, I will argue that Gauthier’s theory of Contractarianism does not lead to unacceptable
            implications regarding our treatment of individuals who cannot benefit us. The primary critique offered
            towards Gauthier’s theory states that a contractarian must concede that i. beings incapable of forming moral
            contracts do not deserve moral consideration and ii. actions whose consequences future generations must face
            are morally justified (since individuals of the future cannot benefit us in the present). I will analyze the
            principal cases perceived in both categories and hence prove that Gauthier’s theory accounts for them.
        </p>
        <p>
            The first primary critique offered towards contractarianism is that beings that lack the capability of
            rational interaction would not deserve moral consideration within a contractarian moral framework.
            Gauthier’s theory puts forward a notion of maximizing utility given certain constraints which are negotiated
            in a premoral bargaining situation. However, since beings that do not possess the capability to reciprocate
            benefits to others and interact with others in a rational manner cannot participate in such a premoral
            bargaining situation, they would not deserve moral consideration. It is thus apparent that within a
            contractarian framework, the moral value of cognitively disabled individuals that is intuitively apparent to
            us cannot be accounted for. At the most, their moral value would be contingent on their relationships with
            other rational human beings, i.e. they would not possess any intrinsic moral value, but their moral worth
            would be determined by how other humans view them. Intuitively, this conclusion seems to be unacceptable and
            seems to provide a case for ableism.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is important to recognize, however, that the above objection overlooks one key idea: not all individuals
            with cognitive disabilities are born as such. Several individuals are born able-minded but over time develop
            mental impairments. This may be due to old age, brain disorders, or due to accidents. All individuals in
            Gauthier’s premoral bargaining situation would recognize
            that given the fact that there is a reasonable chance that they can develop cognitive disabilities such that
            they would no longer possess an ability to reason, they would obviously have a preference to be live a life
            free from harm if such a situation were to arise. However, in a society that does not consider disabled
            individuals as worthy of moral value, this preference can never be satisfied. The only way this preference
            can be satisfied is by constructing a society wherein disabled individuals are considered to have an
            intrinsic moral value, and this is the society that any individual in the premoral bargaining situation
            would advocate for. Hence, Gauthier’s contractarianism clearly provides moral consideration to disabled
            individuals even though they may not be able to benefit us.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another objection to contractarianism stemming from the same category is that non-human animals, who are
            also incapable of rational thought, would not deserve moral consideration within a contractarian moral
            framework. Much like the case of disabled individuals, the moral value of non-human animals would at the
            most be determined by their relationships with other rational human beings. This also raises an issue that
            must be addressed since the above implication fringes on speciesism. The objection points that no individual
            in the premoral bargaining situation would be compelled to extend moral value to non-human animals. However,
            I believe that conclusion is invalid because the premoral bargaining situation that is being considered here
            includes a layer of abstractness that needs to be removed.
        </p>
        <p>
            The appropriate premoral situation here would be a version of 20th century political philosopher John Rawls’
            thought experiment that helped determine how best to organize society.1 This thought experiment is not one
            in which only man-made institution is abstracted but one where all but rationality is abstracted. He asks us
            to imagine ourselves in a premoral situation behind a veil of ignorance. From this position, one would not
            know whether they would
            enter society as male or female, black or white, rich or poor. Rawls argues that by virtue of absence of any
            bias towards a particular group, it is from this position that we would be best equipped to design the most
            just society
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider now a slightly altered version of Rawls’ thought experiment: you are behind the veil of ignorance
            and instead of entering society as a human being, you are about to enter it as a thing.2 You could very
            likely enter the world as a pen, or a tree, or a hammer, or a pig: as any object in the world. From this
            position, knowing that you could be a hammer would not make you want to prevent hammers from being used to
            hit things since you would not know that you are a hammer; being insentient, you would not feel anything. On
            the other hand, knowing that you could enter society as a pig, you would have a preference to live a life
            without harm. As a result, this preference will be bargained for in that premoral society. Therefore,
            contractarianism does provide moral value to non-human animals.
        </p>
        <p>
            One may argue that Gauthier’s theory would not allow this thought experiment since he does not directly
            advocate for it and thus, the above argument cannot apply to his theory. However, it is important to note
            that Gauthier’s theory does not necessarily rule out the veil of ignorance. Rather, he acknowledges that it
            simply is beyond the scope of his argument against the amoralist: “it is not part of my argument to show
            that the requirements of contractarian morality will satisfy the Rawlsian test of cohering with our
            considered judgements in reflective equilibrium”.3 In addition, the premoral bargaining situation that
            Gauthier proposes wherein only man-made institutions are abstracted is a subset of the premoral situation I
            have proposed above and he relies on this premoral situation because it is sufficient in making his case,
            not because he deems anything different as unacceptable. Therefore, Rawls’ thought experiment is a valid
            extension of Gauthier’s premoral bargaining situation and can soundly be used to account for the case of
            non-human animals.
        </p>
        <p>
            The second prime objection to contractarianism is that the theory entails that actions whose negative
            consequences future generations will have to face are morally permissible. A direct implication of
            contractarianism that this objection brings forth is that it would be acceptable to perform actions that
            cause climate change since such actions mark a temporary increase of utility and their negative consequences
            would not have to be faced by us.
        </p>
        <p>
            In order to tackle this objection, consider the members of a society of the distant future. These members
            would have a preference to not face the consequences of climate change as a result of which a hypothetical
            contract is proposed by the members of this society to their direct predecessors. These predecessors also
            have a preference to not face the consequences of climate change and they project the same hypothetical
            contract to their predecessors. This regression follows through all the way till the very first human
            society. The members of this first society lived in the original “state of nature”4 and had only an
            evolutionary preference to ensure the continuation of the human species. By virtue of this preference, the
            members of this original human society reciprocate the hypothetical contract presented to them by a future
            generation. Therefore, a series of hypothetical contracts exist between different generations. It is thus
            clear that the objection raised in the previous paragraph is invalid and contractarianism does not deem it
            moral to perform actions that cause suffering to future generations.
        </p>
        <p>
            In conclusion, Gauthier’s theory of Contractarianism does not lead to unacceptable implications regarding
            our treatment of individuals who cannot benefit us. The primary objections against contractarianism, namely
            our treatment of those individuals that lack an ability
            for rational thought and individuals of the future, are not valid thereby indicating that Gauthier’s theory
            provides moral consideration for even those individuals who cannot benefit us.
