    Can Justice Exist Between Humans and Animals? An Aristotelian Analysis.
  </h3>
  <div>
    <p>
      In this paper, I will demonstrate that justice towards animals
      <strong>exists</strong>
      within the Aristotelian framework. I will do this by analyzing the
      reasoning behind Aristotle’s rejection of the notion that justice can
      exist towards animals and critiquing the arguments he offers to support
      his position.
    </p>
    <p>
      If I am successful in my endeavor, the manner in which we discuss
      morality must be altered. Particularly, the fact that animals are
      capable of being treated (un)justly will have to be taken into
      consideration when discussing ethics; animals will have to be granted
      moral consideration. For the consequentialist, this means that the
      interests of animals would have to be accounted for in the calculus that
      determines the moral course of action. On the other hand, for the
      non-consequentialist, this means that there would exist reasons,
      exclusive of the consequences of an action, to act such that the
      interests of non-human animals are upheld. As a result, we would have to
      seriously re-evaluate our current treatment of non-human animals. That
      is, we ought to scrutinize the manner in which we confine animals in
      factory farms wherein they experience acute amounts of pain throughout
      their short lives, but we would also have to re-evaluate how we view
      them in general. I hope that this paper also highlights the shaky
      grounds upon which consuming animal flesh and secretions stands.
    </p>
    <p>
      A brief roadmap. This paper is divided into five sections. In the first
      section, I will provide an overview of Aristotle’s position and two
      primary arguments he offers in support of it. The second and third
      sections are dedicated to addressing the first argument Aristotle
      offers, while the fourth section addresses the second argument he offers
      in support of the impossibility of the existence of justice towards
      animals. The final section is a brief conclusion.
    </p>
    <p><b>Section I. Introduction</b></p>
    <p>
      Aristotle presents his conception of justice in relation to the
      existence of <i>injustice</i>. He writes that “justice exists only
      between men whose mutual relations are governed by law; and law exists
      for men between whom there is injustice.” That is, justice exists only
      insofar as injustice exists. Thus, in order to show that justice towards
      animals can exist, it would suffice to show that injustice towards
      animals can exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      We claim that an injustice has occurred when one has been wronged. For
      instance, stealing someone’s property is unjust because the person whose
      property was stolen has been wronged. Justice to the victim, in this
      instance, could then (at the very least) be the undoing of the unjust
      action, i.e., the restoration of the stolen property. Thus, for justice
      to exist towards animals, it must be that animals are capable of being
      wronged by humans (more on this in Section V).
    </p>
    <p>
      I have identified two chief arguments Aristotle offers to support the
      claim that justice towards animals cannot exist. His first argument is
      that because animals cannot form social contracts with humans, justice
      towards them cannot exist. I will address this argument in the following
      two sections. His second argument stems from the claim that one cannot
      wrong an entity over which one has ownership. Aristotle believes that
      humans have ownership over animals, and therefore, animals cannot be
      wronged by humans. So, justice towards animals cannot exist. I will
      address this argument in the penultimate two sections of this paper.
    </p>
    <p><b>Section II. Aristotle’s First Argument </b></p>
    <p>
      Aristotle holds that animals are natural slaves of human beings because
      “there is nothing common” between humans and animals. The commonality he
      refers to, or lack thereof, is an ability to “be party to an agreement,”
      i.e., an ability to form a social contract. Thus, according to
      Aristotle, since a social contract cannot exist between humans and
      animals, justice towards animals cannot exist.
    </p>
    <pre>
        The form of this argument can be formally represented as follows:
          1. If x can be (un)just to y, a social contract can exist between x and y 
          2. A social contract cannot exist between x and y 
          3. Therefore, x cannot be (un)just to y
      </pre>
    <p>
      In addition, Aristotle asserts that animals are incapable of rational
      thought. Sorabji notes that in rejecting the notion that animals are
      capable of reason, Aristotle denies that they are capable of having true
      or false beliefs. Thus, Aristotle posits that animals must therefore be
      incapable of forming social contracts because doing so presupposes
      having a belief that the contract is good for themselves. Accordingly,
      since a social contract cannot exist between humans and animals due to
      the fact that animals are incapable of reason, justice towards animals
      cannot exist.
    </p>
    <p>
      Singer’s argument from marginal cases is a direct response to premise 1
      of the above argument. Since Aristotle posits that the ability to form a
      social contract (and therefore a capacity for rationality) is a
      requirement for one to be treated unjustly, a severely cognitively
      impaired child whose capacity for rationality does not exceed that of a
      pig cannot be treated unjustly. As a result, holding the impaired child
      in isolation within pens that restrict any possibility of movement and
      slaughtering them once they have grown to an appropriate size would be
      non-problematic.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although this implication opposes the ethical intuitions of perhaps even
      the most obstinate speciesist, I find that Aristotle would be compelled
      to accept it. This is not only because rejecting the implication would
      compromise logical consistency but also because Aristotle would not
      consider individuals who are incapable of reason as members of the human
      species. Aristotle defines a ‘human being’ as a ‘rational animal.’
      Accordingly, any animal that lacks the capacity for rationality would,
      by definition, not be considered to be a human being. Thus, in
      Aristotle’s worldview, animals, as well as severely cognitively impaired
      individuals, would not deserve moral consideration. I imagine, however,
      that most ethically serious individuals would be compelled to reject
      premise 1 of Aristotle’s argument upon learning of its implications.
    </p>
    <p><b>Section III. </b></p>
    <p>
      Another line of argumentation against Aristotle’s reasoning questions
      his support for the premise that animals cannot form social contracts
      (premise 2). In particular, Aristotle’s rationale that since animals are
      incapable of reason, they cannot form social contracts can be critiqued.
    </p>
    <p>
      In his seminal On Abstinence from Killing Animals, Porphyry dedicates a
      large portion of the text to show that animals are capable of reasoning.
      He fundamentally challenges the dichotomy made by Aristotle between
      rational and non-rational when positing a difference in kind between
      humans and animals. That is, he argues against Aristotle that the
      difference in rationality between humans and animals is not one of kind,
      but one of degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the arguments Porphyry offers against the notion that animals are
      incapable of reason goes as follows. He writes that much like the
      existence of the pair immortal and mortal, if the rational exists, “the
      irrational must exist as its opposite.” The irrational, he argues,
      exists and is “important and abundant” in everything that lacks a soul.
      Moreover, just as how it is absurd to create a dichotomy between
      sentient and non-sentient aspects or aspects with and without impression
      in animate creatures, “it is also not plausible to require that an
      animate creature should have a rational and an irrational aspect.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Aristotle denies reason to animals altogether in several texts
      , he admits in one instance that animals are capable of practical wisdom
      (phronesis). Specifically, Aristotle admits that some animals possess “a
      power of foresight with regard to their own life.” This hypothesis
      explains why animals choose a particular end – ingesting water to quench
      thirst, for instance – as well as the means they employ to achieve the
      end – drinking the water. Nevertheless, he remains committed to the view
      that only “the human race lives also by art and reasonings.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Porphyry criticizes the methodology in which Aristotle reaches this
      conclusion. He writes:
    </p>
    <pre>
        If we do not understand how an animal acts because we cannot enter 
        into their reasoning, we shall not therefore accuse them of 
        non-rationality. No one can enter the intellect of God, but from 
        the acts of the sun we agree with those who proclaim him to be 
        intellectual and rational. 
      </pre>
    <p>
      Here, Porphyry touches upon the fact that Aristotle begins with the
      assumption that animals are incapable of reason and attempts to
      formulate a post hoc rationalization to explain any evidence that
      supports the existence of a capacity to reason within animals. This
      methodology is problematic; particularly, given the impossibility of
      entering into the minds of animals, why must the starting point be
      non-rationality and not rationality?
    </p>
    <p>
      I am aware that these arguments do not demonstrate that animals are
      capable of forming social contracts. However, they succeed in revealing
      the dubiousness of the claim that because animals cannot reason, they
      cannot form social contracts. Furthermore, some studies have shown that
      animals are, in fact, capable of forming non-verbal social contracts
      with humans. Thus, since there exists, at the very least, uncertainty
      about the claim that animals cannot reason, there must also exist
      uncertainty about the claim that animals cannot form social contracts.
      In particular, one would have to provide separate argumentation in order
      to show that animals cannot form social contracts (the burden for which
      lies on the Aristotelian). Hence, we have arrived (at least) at a
      position of agnosticism regarding whether animals can form social
      contracts, revealing that Aristotle’s argument for why justice towards
      animals cannot exist remains unsubstantiated.
    </p>
    <p><b>Section III. Aristotle’s Second Argument</b></p>
    <p>
      Another support Aristotle offers for the impossibility of justice
      towards animals is rooted in his belief that animals exist “for the sake
      of man.” That is, since animals belong to man, it must be impossible to
      wrong them. Accordingly, the absence of a possibility to wrong animals
      implies the absence of a possibility to extend (in)justice towards
      animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      While Aristotle does not offer direct argumentation for the claim that
      since animals belong to humans, it is impossible to wrong them, we can
      infer this position from his discussion of justice towards one’s slaves
      and one’s women and children. One might argue that animals differ from
      slaves, women, and children in that they possess different degrees of
      rationality. This difference subsequently reveals that Aristotle’s
      position on the presence of justice towards the latter cannot be applied
      to animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      Although Aristotle indeed recognizes that – unlike animals – slaves,
      women, and children “share in rational principle,” he believes that like
      animals, they lack a proper faculty of deliberation. On this, he writes:
      “the slave has no deliberative faculty at all; the woman has it, but it
      is without authority; and the child has, but it is immature.” As a
      result, Aristotle declares that “the use of slaves and of tame animals
      is not very different.”
    </p>
    <p>
      Aristotle holds that the virtues of men and those of slaves, women, and
      children are not the same. The virtues of women, for instance, are only
      proportionate to their duties and do not exceed that of the man.
      According to Aristotle, because men have command over women, “the
      courage of a man is shown in commanding, of a woman in obeying.”
      Therefore, since the virtues of a man greatly exceed the virtues of
      those he commands, it would be impossible for man to wrong them. The
      same reasoning applies to non-human animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      The above position also stems from the belief that you cannot wrong an
      entity that is entirely your own. For example, if I put my foot in
      harm’s way, it cannot be said that I have wronged my foot. A more
      precise description would be that I have wronged myself since my foot
      belongs to me. However, Aristotle provides little argumentation to
      support his belief that slaves, women, children, and non-human animals
      belong to man. He assumes that they belong to man as a starting point
      and builds his theories from there. Thus, his belief that justice
      towards animals cannot exist is based on an unsubstantiated premise.
    </p>
    <p>
      From this discussion, I want to highlight that the issues of justice
      commonplace today – racism, sexism, and speciesism, for instance – are
      quite related. Such positions that deny moral consideration to someone
      stem from an unsupported dogmatic belief. The burden of proof thus lies
      on the ones who deny moral consideration, and until this burden is
      resolved, the default position should be one wherein moral consideration
      is not denied.
    </p>
    <p><b>Section IV. Animals Can Be Wronged</b></p>
    <p>
      In this final section, I will demonstrate that animals are indeed
      capable of being wronged. In his work Topica, Aristotle defines
      ‘wronging’ as “to injure deliberately.” Consider this example: a man
      picks up a club and hits a stray animal several times because he derives
      pleasure from viewing the animal’s injuries. It is trivially apparent
      that the man has deliberately injured the animal. Therefore, by
      Aristotle’s definition of wronging, the man has wronged the animal.
    </p>
    <p>
      In this example, since a human being has wronged an animal, we infer
      that it must be possible for humans to wrong animals. Thus, this example
      refutes the claim that it is impossible to wrong animals. Furthermore,
      since it is possible to wrong animals, the Aristotelian must concede
      that justice towards animals exists.
    </p>
    <p>
      One might argue that by consuming meat, dairy, and eggs, they are not
      committing an injustice towards animals because although the animals
      bred for these products do suffer injury, the consumer does not purchase
      the products with the intention of causing injury. By consuming animal
      products, one is not deliberately injuring animals. Consequently, they
      are not committing an injustice towards the animals. This line of
      reasoning perfectly serves as an Aristotelian argument against veganism.
      However, I find that this says less about the moral status of non-human
      animals and more about the inadequacy of Aristotle’s definition for
      wronging. For instance, if one accepts this definition, they are
      committed to the view that most instances of rape are just because the
      rapist rapes not with a deliberate intention of causing injury but only
      for the pleasure they derive from the act. If the injury did not exist,
      they would still rape. However, if this pleasure did not exist, they
      would not rape. Any ethically serious individual would reject this
      implication, and therefore the argument that consuming animal flesh and
      secretions is just since the consumer’s intention is not to injure
      deliberately.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, Aristotle’s definition for wronging is not entirely
      useless. Whether an actor has caused injury to a victim deliberately or
      not is helpful in determining the degree of their moral responsibility.
      However, since issues of justice are viewed from the victim’s
      perspective, the pig that suffers in a gas chamber is wronged regardless
      of the degree to which the perpetrator’s actions were deliberate. Any
      apt definition for ‘wronging’ should capture this idea. Since
      Aristotle’s definition of the term is too narrow, a good definition
      would likely be a superset of Aristotle’s definition; as a result, the
      argument I have offered for the existence of justice towards animals
      would likely hold even for a different definition. What exactly serves
      as a good definition for the term lies outside the scope of this paper,
      however.
    </p>
    <p><b>Section V. Conclusion</b></p>
    <p>
      In this paper, I hope to have done the following things. Firstly, by
      critiquing Aristotle’s support for the impossibility of justice towards
      animals, I hope to have demonstrated that justice towards animals can
      exist within the Aristotelian framework. Secondly, I hope to have shown
      that the arguments I have offered do not fail outside the Aristotelian
      framework. This is because the grounds upon which the exploitation of
      animals is maintained are similar across most major ethical frameworks,
      and thus, the arguments I have offered should extend and apply within
      other frameworks as well.
